Dispite coming from a hospitality background I have always had a passion for the world of technology. As for my educational background, it is one centered in music and art.

I do not have any active hobby projects at the moment but for the future I aspire to launch a website 
for a friend; that resides in another country, that makes a delicious homemade hot sauce.

I have experience with HTML5, CSS, and some Javascript. For HTML5, I am able to create a structured webpage as well as incorporate accessability. For CSS, I am able to make webpages responsive through the use of median queries flexbox and grid layout. I also know about the mobile first approach known as Bootstraps. Javascript is a working progress at the moment but I am able to read and write basic code as well as manipulate the DOM to some degree.
